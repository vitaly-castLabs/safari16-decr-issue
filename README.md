Demo for a decryption bug intorduced in Safari 16 / arm macs: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251137

It's hosted [here](https://vitaly-castlabs.github.io/safari16-decr-issue/) and needs to be open with Safari or Safari Tech Preview as it uses FairPlay. On Intel-powered macs / Safari 15 it plays to the end, while with M1/M2 macs and Safari 16 it throws an error in about 2s (time code 2m41s61).
